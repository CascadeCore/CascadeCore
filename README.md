## About me
I'm new to programming and focused on learning the fundamentals: Python, building small apps, and learning how to deploy and operate services. This profile is a place to track my learning progress and share beginner projects as I build them.

## Learning roadmap (short-term)
- Learn Python basics: syntax, data structures, and OOP
- Git & GitHub: commits, branches, PRs, and issues
- Build a small project and publish it on GitHub
- Learn web basics and FastAPI for APIs
- Learn Docker and simple deployment (local/homelab)

## Beginner project ideas (pick one to start)
- Todo CLI app (Python) — learn I/O, persistence (file/SQLite), and tests  
- Personal website / portfolio — HTML/CSS + simple deploy (GitHub Pages)  
- Small REST API (FastAPI) — a single-resource API (notes/todos) with Docker  
- Automation script — process files or rename photos, practice scripting

Start tiny: one feature first, then add tests and README.

## How I’ll show progress
- Create a repo per project and pin it to my profile
- Use the project README to explain what it does and how to run it
- Keep a short dev log in issues or the project README for what I learned

## Tech I’m learning
Python · Git/GitHub · FastAPI · Docker · Linux · Kubernetes (intro)

## Resources I’m using
- Official Python docs / tutorial  
- freeCodeCamp & YouTube tutorials for FastAPI and Docker  
- GitHub Docs for Git/git workflows

## Want to help or collaborate?
I’m open to feedback, mentorship, and small tasks to learn from. If you’re willing to guide a beginner, leave a comment or open an issue in one of my repositories.

## Contact
- Reach me on GitHub: open an issue in this repo or send a message via my profile
